AI has tremendous potential to improve all different aspects of our lives – leading to changes in many facets of life, including making our day-to-day lives easier, allowing for  more personalized healthcare, and generating insights as we live and learn. There are also challenges and potential issues that we should consider, such as:

* How are people affected differently by AI?
* How might aspects of one’s culture, background, and other characteristics or traits affect how we might respond to AI?
* How might these considerations inform how we regard or develop applications involving AI?
* How do we collaboratively work towards integrating the values and preferences of communities of interest in AI tools?

This workshop seeks to bring together researchers, practitioners, and others who work with (or are interested in working with) culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations. All levels of technical expertise welcome!

**Event purposes**: 
1. raise awareness about the importance of thoughtful engagement in the design of AI applications for culturally and linguistically diverse populations; 
2. offer a venue to engage in activities to think about relevant concepts and build relevant skills; and 
3. present and hear about the work of others on this topic.

**Expected lessons learned**: 
1. experiential learning experiences with prompt engineering;
2. takeaways and strategies for working with communities of interest

**Workshop locations**: 
University of Washington (UW); University of California, Irvine (UCI); and virtual.

**Event Sponsors**: 
Association for Information Science & Technology (ASIS&T) U.S. West Chapter and UCI Connected Learning Lab.
