* The workshop will fully support virtual participation. UW and UCI will support in-person participation.
* The research presentations will be viewed collectively (in-person at each site and virtually). 
* Poster sessions and the tutorial/chatbot kickstarter activity will be led separately at each site and virtually, and then converge in a collective debrief.

## Tutorial + Chatbot Kickstarter Activity:

This tutorial will engage attendees in the exploratory development of a chatbot using design- and impact-based methodologies. In the first part, we will walk through a tutorial of how to shape a chatbot using prompt engineering, and discuss design considerations. In the second part, we will break out in small groups to work on a chatbot kickstarter activity. Group facilitators will lead case studies (information provided), such as:

* Language, culture, relatability, and accessibility in the tailoring of chatbots to assist older adults in healthcare 
* Managing identity and legacy with personal digital collections
* Engage in participatory collaboration to design learning technologies that identify and are responsive to the needs and preferences of communities that have historically been underserved

You can work together on a case study or bring your own topics to develop further!

The activity will include: identify and are responsive to the needs and preferences of communities, integration of these into chatbot development, and chatbot evaluation. This is intended as an opportunity to: have a good time, meet new people with similar interests, and collaboratively explore possibilities for future work!
