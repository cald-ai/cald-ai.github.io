# When and Where
* **Date:** April 29th, 2025
* **Venue:** Online
* **Schedule**: [here]()

# Call for Participation

AI has tremendous potential to improve all different aspects of our lives – and leading to changes in many facets of life, including making our day-to-day lives easier, resulting in more personalized healthcare, and generating insights as we live and learn. 

However, there are also challenges and potential issues that we should consider, including:
*	How are people affected differently by AI?
*	How might aspects of one’s cultural, background, and other characteristics or traits affect how we might respond to AI?
*	How might these considerations inform how we regard or develop applications involving AI?
*	How do collaboratively work towards integrating the values and preferences of communities of interest in AI tools?

If you are interested in, doing research on, or working on topics relating to these questions, consider participating in this upcoming hybrid workshop!

This workshop seeks to bring together researchers, practitioners, and others who work with culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations. 

# Workshop Description

## Research/practice presentations
Participants will present their work, followed by a Q&A session.

## Poster sessions
Present your ideas/early-stage work and obtain feedback! Poster sessions will be held in breakout rooms, and attendees will be encouraged to “rotate” so there will be opportunities to see a variety of projects and engage with other attendees.

## Tutorial + Chatbot Kickstarter Activity
This tutorial will engage attendees to engage in exploratory development of a chatbot using design- and impact-based methodologies. In the first part, we will walk through how to develop a chatbot, using the use case of a chatbot intended to assist an older adult with limited English proficiency make sense of health information and discuss design considerations. In the second part, we will break out in small groups to work on a chatbot kickstarter activity. Group facilitators will lead case studies (information provided), such as:

*	Language, culture, and empathy in the tailoring of chatbots to assist older adults in healthcare 
*	Managing identity and legacy with personal digital collections
*	Developing library services to address the needs of communities that have historically been underserved

You can work together on a case study or bring your own topics to develop further!

The activity will include: identifying user needs, integrating them into chatbot development, and chatbot evaluation. This is intended as an opportunity to: have a good time, meet new people with similar interests, and collaboratively explore possibilities for future work!
